title: Lanier Python Fall Sessions
subtitle: From early October and Late December we had members coordinate with a local middle school to host after school sessions on Python. All meetings were ran in conjuction with the Lanier Coding Club, and occurred weekly from 4:00 to 5:00 on teams. Students were lead through Python fundamentals, and learned the importance of object oriented programming.
